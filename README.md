# Bodhi-Bday
This repository contains audio file/s articulating Bodhipaksa's name into a chime using a musical alphabet. 
  The muscial alphabet used here is based on mod 7. Mod stands for modolo or remainder. We take the position number of the letter, divide it by 7 and using the value obtained (0...6) to map it to seven pitches where 0=A ....6=G. 
  Of course there are many other possible transposition and the possibility for rhythmic variations. 
More to play with !
